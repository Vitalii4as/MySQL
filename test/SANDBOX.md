# Sandbox

This folder contains convenient scripts and configuration to boot MySQL 5.x and 8.x testing instances in seconds with provisioned databases already setup.

For now the [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) sample database is available for initial testing and playground.  A more extensive one will be added soon.

## Commands

From the root of this repository you can run the following `npm`commands (note they only work on Mac OS for now)

```bash
# Start and stop instances with autogenerated SSL certificates
npm run start-test-instances
npm run stop-test-instances

# sync the content of this repository with the plugin code in your HOME folder ($HOME/.hackolade/plugin/MySQL)
# It could require running preliminary mkdir -p $HOME/.hackolade/plugin/MySQL
npm run sync
```

### TODO

- Add setup for local dns configuration or ENV var support to pass a CUSTOM DNS (used with certificates, they are now pointing to volodymir.local)
